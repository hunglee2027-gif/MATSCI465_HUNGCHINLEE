# MATSCI465_HUNGCHINLEE

 In this assignment 01, we install several package and import in jupyter lab successfully. After upload and open a tif file with Hyperspy, we can see a clearly image.\
 With RGB data form of this tif image, we transform it into grayscale image and measure the pixel intesity and each intensities' frequency of the image.\
 After the work above, we can say that we can run the code successfully with code and able to do the following analysis to 4DSTEM work.
