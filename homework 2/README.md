# 4D-STEM Analysis Pipeline: Si/SiGe Heterostructure Characterization
This project implements an automated analytical pipeline for 4D-STEM (Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) datasets. The primary focus is on characterizing the interface of a Si/SiGe heterostructure through virtual imaging and diffraction statistical analysis.
## Task 1: Distinguish Naviation v.s. Signal Axes
In this work, we generate the Diffraction Pattern (DP) and found out the Navigation Axes should be the size of (77, 17), and the Signal Axes should be the size of (480, 448)
## Task 2: Diffraction Analysis Function

## Task 3: Build the Analysis Pipeline

## Task 4: Apply to Si/SiGe Dataset
